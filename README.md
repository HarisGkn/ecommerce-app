A simple react e-commerce app tat was created using firebase for authentication and deployment.
* It includes some dummy products and a functional cart.
* The user doesn't have to register an account to use the app but has the option to.
* In the checkout/payment page the user can review his cart and his delivery info. normally I would make this functional but this was only created so i could practice react. If I was to make it functional I would probably use stripe for the payment method.
